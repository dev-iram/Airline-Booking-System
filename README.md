FUNCTIONALITY
1.	The Cyanair Booking System will be protected via a Login (There will be 2 roles – Flight Representative and an Administrator)
2.	The system will allow the user to then choose between either the Booking System or the Maintenance Suite. The choice will only be available to the Administrator. The Flight Representative will only have the Booking System as an option.

8.	After the flight has been confirmed, a booking reference number will be generated. 
9.	The user will then have the option to create a new booking.
10.	The Maintenance Suite will allow access to only the Administrator where they will be able to view/add/delete airports and to view bookings.
