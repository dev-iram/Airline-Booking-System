# Cyanair-Airline-Booking-System
 This is a project I created as per specifications in C&amp;G OOP module during the course of my FIT ICTAP Software Development apprenticeship. -> Created in C# -> Visual Studio
 
 
 
 Cyanair, an independent start-up Irish Airline, are currently unable to sell record their passenger data information and details sufficiently due to their current system which operates only paper-based transactions and records customer data through the use of spreadsheets. There is no system that allows flights to be booked electronically for the use of the Flight Representatives to record and retain information. 


A graphical user interface that allows customers to select criteria an intended flight:
1.	Departure Airport
2.	Destination Airport
3.	Type of Seats (Economy, Business, First) 



Please create /data/Cyanair.db in Local Disk if it does not open the database (Cyanair.db file is located in main project folder + debug)

-> Username credentials for testing; username: testing password: password

-> To test for flights;
