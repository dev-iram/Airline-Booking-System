## Assignment Brief
Cyanair, an independent start-up Irish Airline, are currently unable to sell record their passenger data information and details sufficiently due to their current system which operates only paper-based transactions and records customer data through the use of spreadsheets. There is no system that allows flights to be booked electronically for the use of the Flight Representatives to record and retain information.  
  
The project requirements involve an Object-Oriented GUI program that is going to be used as the airline’s booking system. The methods that the airline would like featured in this application will allow a user to select criteria for an intended flight, which include:  
  
✦ Departure Airport  
✦ Destination Airport  
✦ Type of Seats (Economy, Business, First)

### Functionality
✦ Cyanair Booking System will be protected via a Login (There will be 2 roles – Flight Representative and an Administrator)  
✦	The system will allow the user to then choose between either the Booking System or the Maintenance Suite. The choice will only be available to the Administrator.
  The Flight Representative will only have the Booking System as an option.  
✦	The Booking System will allow the Flight Representative to make bookings on behalf of passengers via the booking process.  
✦	The system will allow for Departure and Destination flights to be selected, along with the date for the flight.  
✦	The system will allow One Way, Return, or Onward Leg flights  
✦	The system will proceed to gather the passenger details  
✦	After all of the passenger’s information has been gathered, the system will ask for a booking confirmation, with all of the information regarding the flight booking being produced on the screen  
✦	After the flight has been confirmed, a booking reference number will be generated.   
✦	The user will then have the option to create a new booking.  
✦	The Maintenance Suite will allow access to only the Administrator where they will be able to view/add/delete airports and to view bookings.  
✦ Help System available to help the user of the program (Integrated within the application)
