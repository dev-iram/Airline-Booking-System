# Cyanair-Airline-Booking-System
 This is a project I created as per specifications in C&amp;G OOP module during the course of my FIT ICTAP Software Development apprenticeship. -> Created in C# -> Visual Studio
 
 
 
 Cyanair, an independent start-up Irish Airline, are currently unable to sell record their passenger data information and details sufficiently due to their current system which operates only paper-based transactions and records customer data through the use of spreadsheets. There is no system that allows flights to be booked electronically for the use of the Flight Representatives to record and retain information.
